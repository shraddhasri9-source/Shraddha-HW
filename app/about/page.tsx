              Shraddha began with a simple belief: that good handwriting is a skill anyone can learn, at any
              age. What started as small handwriting batches for school children has grown into a complete writing
              academy covering everything from neat everyday handwriting to the fine art of calligraphy.

              Today we run two complementary wings under one roof. Our <strong className="text-ink">Handwriting Improvement</strong>{' '}
              programs help kids, students, and professionals write neatly and confidently. Our{' '}
              <strong className="text-ink">Calligraphy Art</strong> programs guide hobbyists and creatives into the beautiful
              world of decorative lettering.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every program is built on patient, personal instruction in small batches — because real improvement comes
              from consistent guidance and the right practice, not generic worksheets.
